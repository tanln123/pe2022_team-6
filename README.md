## Project: Pharmacy Management System

The aim of this project is to develop an application for the effective management of a pharmaceutical store. It helps the pharmacist to maintain the records of the medicines/drugs and supplies sent in by the supplier. The admin who are handling the organization will be responsible to manage the record of the employee. Each employee will be given with a separate username and password. The users can communicate each other by using a built-in messaging system. Pharmacy management system deals with the maintenance of drugs and consumables in the pharmacy unit. It application can generate invoices, bills, receipts etc.
